        <h2> My 3 top movies of all-times </h2>
        <hr />

        <h3> Saving Private Ryan</h3>
        <p> I love the theme of personal sacrifice for a great cause. <br />
            I really like Private Ryan's way of thinking about living a life <br />
            worthy of the sacrifice others made to bring him home. </p>

        <h3> Hacksaw Ridge</h3>
        <p> The theme of personal sacrifice to save others in Desmond Doss <br />
            is due to his love for his personal savior: Jesus Christ.</p>

        <h3> La Cucaracha </h3>
        <p> Mexican film. Colonel Zeta must follow General Villa's orders <br />
            to organize an attack on a city to serve as bait, even if it <br />
            costs him his own life and that of his people.</p>
