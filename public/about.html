<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello. I'm Reuben Fons. I'm 52 years old and I love programming. I've enjoyed it since I was a child, but only now am I starting to learn.
  I'm very passionate about programming, history, and the Bible. I've already studied Theology and History, and I plan to become a great programmer before the year ends.
  Consider me your friend from now on, and feel free to contact me.</p>
